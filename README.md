My assignments for homework for the Computational Data Mining course at Amirkabir University of Technology taught by Dr. Fatemeh Shakeri.

A total of 10 homework were given in this course. Each assignment has a different topic, and I tried to solve all of them, and I hope you find them useful. 

## Summary

Briefly, the homework were as follows:

- `Homework 1`: Comparison of different RGB to Gray scaler converters
  
- `Homework 2`: MNIST Digit Recognition Using Average of Images
  
- `Homework 3`: Denoising RGB Images Using SVD
  
- `Homework 4`: MNIST Digit Recognition Using Least Squares Problem
  
- `Bonus Homework`: Implementation and Performance Analysis of KMeans 
  
- `Homework 5`: NMF vs. K-means
  
- `Homework 6`: Implementation and Performance Analysis of Page Rank Algorithm
  
- `Homework 7`: MDS & ISOMap for Dimensionality Reduction of Facial Images
